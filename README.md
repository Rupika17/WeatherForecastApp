Implementation Details:

- The app's main component is WeatherApp.tsx, located in the src/components directory.

- The project uses TypeScript for type-safe development and improved tooling.

- The Redux state management is not included in this basic example. You can extend the project by implementing Redux for managing the application's state.

- API integration is not implemented in this basic example. You can add API calls to fetch weather data for the provided city input.
